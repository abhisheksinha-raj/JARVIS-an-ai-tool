# Jarvis - AI Voice Assistant (Python)

Jarvis is a Python-based voice-controlled assistant designed to perform everyday tasks such as playing music, opening applications, searching the web, and more.  
The assistant uses speech recognition and text-to-speech technology to interact with the user through voice commands.
